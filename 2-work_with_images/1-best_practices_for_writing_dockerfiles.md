# [Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/) #

----------

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a `Dockerfile`, a text file that contains all the commands, in order, needed to build a given image. Below are some sample dockerfiles:

* [Buildpack-deps](https://github.com/docker-library/buildpack-deps/blob/master/jessie/Dockerfile) 
* [Ubuntu](https://github.com/dockerfile/ubuntu/blob/master/Dockerfile) 

The second link above actually provide some other dockerfiles with different development environments: [https://github.com/dockerfile](https://github.com/dockerfile)
